#### 0. Can you come up out 3 sceneries which use AI methods?

Ans: Face recognition, chatting bots, recommender systems



#### 1. How do we use GitHub; Why do we use Jupyter and Pycharm;

Ans: We use GitHub to host and review code, manage projects, and build with other developers.

Jupyter is flexible web application that allows us to create and share documents that contain live code, mathematical formulas, visualizations and narrative text.

Pycharm is a strong Python IDE with intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error checking and many other practical functions. It can help us code better. 

#### 2. What's the Probability Model?

Ans: A probability model is a mathematical representation of a random phenomenon. It is defined by its sample space, events within the sample space, and probabilities associated with each event.

#### 3. Can you came up with some sceneries at which we could use Probability Model?

Ans: Coin flip, gamble, weather prediction.



#### 4. Why do we use probability and what's the difficult points for programming based on parsing and pattern match?

Ans: In NLP, we use probability to calculate the correlation between context by logic since it cannot understand the real emotion.

The difficulty is that the natural language is very complex and disordered. It's hard to find a programming model to satisfy many real texts.

#### 5. What's the Language Model;

Ans: A statistical language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given such a sequence, say of length m, it assigns a probability to the whole sequence. Having a way to estimate the relative likelihood of different phrases is useful in many natural language processing applications, especially ones that generate text as an output.

#### 6. Can you came up with some sceneries at which we could use Language Model?

Ans: Emotion AI, thematic words extraction, voice recognition



#### 7. What's the 1-gram language model;

Ans: 1-gram is a contiguous sequence of 1 items from a given sample of text or speech for predicting the next item in such a sequence.



#### 8. What's the disadvantages and advantages of 1-gram language model;

Ans: Disadvantages: out-of-vocabulary words when the input includes words which were not present in a system;s dictionary or database.

Advantages: simplicity and scalability - with larger *n*, a model can store more context with a well-understood spaceâ€“time tradeoff, enabling small experiments to scale up efficiently.



#### 9. What's the 2-gram models;

Ans: 2-gram is a contiguous sequence of 2 items from a given sample of text or speech for predicting the next item in such a sequence.
